                Description of the image: Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of some of the most known game franchises of all time, posing in front of Link from The Legend of Zelda and Mario. Two iconic characters from Nintendo; many games have been made from both characters. To be honest, I like Mario more.<br>
                <br>Image file type information: WebP File<br>
                <br>Why did you choose the image? This man created a company that has made so many games that children and adults alike have spent hundreds of hours on. His game franchises were a large part of my childhood, and he deserves some recognition.<br>
