            <h2>Picture Information:</h2>
            <p>
                Description of the image: Shigeru Miyamoto, the inventor of Nintendo, posing in front of Link from The Legend of Zelda and Mario. Two iconic characters from Nintendo; many games have been made from both characters. To be honest, I like Mario more.<br>
                <br>Image file type information: PNG File<br>
                <br>Why did you choose the image? This man created a company that has made so many games that children and adults alike have spent hundreds of hours on. His game company was a large part of my childhood, and he deserves some recognition.<br>
