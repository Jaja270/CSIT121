                Description of the image: The handsome John Krasinski posing on the red carpet of the IF movie which he directed and also starred in. He is wearing a black sports jacket with a polo underneath. <br>
                <br>Image file type information: JPG File <br>
                <br>Why did you choose the image? The first show I ever saw him in was The Office, and I have watched his work since. Everything from Jack Ryan to A Quiet Place, in my opinion, he is very talented and capable of such great things. <br>
